## switch-case : ##
```
switch(expression)
{
  case expression : statement;
                    break;
  case expression : statement;
                     break;
  default : statement;
}
switch/case statement works only on integral values (an enum, an integral type such as char and int, or an object type with implicit cast to an integral type). 
```
```
In C++, when an integer value is compared with an unsigned it, the int is promoted to unsigned. Negative numbers are stored in 2’s complement form and unsigned value of the 2’s complement form is much higher than the sizeof int.
