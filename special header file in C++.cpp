 <bits/stdc++.h> : It is basically a header file that includes every standard library.
 
 Using it would include a lot of unnecessary stuff and increases compilation time.
 So, the user can either use it and save the time of writing every include or save the compilation time by not using it and 
 writing necessary header files.
